This project is a big academy project. The main goal of the project is to mange IT infrastructure in the computer packs. It was developed with Native Web Development Languages. The project is subdivided in two parts such as: Front-end and Back-end. In Front-end, all user interfaces are built using basic HTML and CSS to draw layouts and controls and JavaScript to make some feedback with users and HTTP requests to Back-end via Node.js. In Back-end, a simple Node.js API is developed to get and treat client requests. Express.js is used as a server to run this project. Note that data is stored in a remote Mongo Cloud Database hosted on Internet. The communication between Front-end and Back-end uses AJAX and data transfer uses JSON language.
