This big project is academic. The main goal of the project is to manage IT
infrastructure in the computer packs. It has been developed with Native Web
Development Languages. The project is subdivided in two parts such as:
Front-end and Back-end. In Front-end, all user interfaces are built
using basic HTML and CSS to draw layouts, controls and JavaScript to
make some feedback with users and HTTP requests to Back-end via Node.js.
In Back-end, a simple Node.js API is developed to get and treat client
requests. Express.js is used as a server to run this project. Note that
data is stored in a remote Mongo Cloud Database hosted on Internet. The
communication between Front-end and Back-end uses AJAX and data transfer
uses JSON language.
